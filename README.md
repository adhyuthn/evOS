## evOS - evo's eXpOS

eXpOS is an attempt to create an operting system from scratch for a hypothetical `XSM` architecture. Designed as per the [Operating Systems Laboratory Course](https://exposnitc.github.io/) at NIT Calicut.
`XSM` is a Assembly like language for writing programs.
`SPL` is an abstraction for `XSM`. It provides simple constructs like loops and aliasing.
`EXPL` is a high level language for writing user programs. Compiles to XSM instructions.

> [!TIP]
> - `configs.sh` contains some functions that eased my way around navigating the the tools.
> - `vim/` contains syntax files for XSM, SPL and EXPL.
