I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feelin', I'm happy again
I'm laughin' at clouds so dark up above
The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase everyone from the place
Come on with the rain, I've a smile on my face
I walk down the lane with a happy refrain
Just singin', singin' in the rain

Dancing in the rain
I'm happy again
